Contributing to Eclipse Che
=====================
Thanks for your interest in this project.

Project Description
--------------------
Che's objective is to create high performance developer environments by producing extensible, RESTful workspaces combined with a cloud IDE that can be customized with plug-ins. Tools are written in Java and run in the browser.

Bugs
-----
This project uses GitHub to track ongoing development and issues.  Please note, January 2015, Codenvy is still in the process of moving all Che issues from their internal Jira to GitHub.  So you may want to send an email to the che-dev alias to check on any issues if you do not see them in Bugzilla.

Areas To Contribute
--------------------
The strength of Che is entirely dependent upon the contributions and involvement of the broader community. We definitely can use your help. The areas where new contributors can get involved:
1. Expanding our documentation at eclipse.org/che, especially around examples for interacting with the REST services and tutorials around building advanced extensions. You will need a password to our README site as the documentation is not under version control. Please write at che-dev@eclipse.org or make a direct edit to the README page.
2. Speaking at agile, development, and DevOps conferences about Eclipse Che. We have stickers and other promotions that you can take to events.
3. Add to the certified stack library, templates, and samples that are available with Che. We are interested in Scala, Swift, Android, Rust, and JavaScript improvements.  It is possible to make pull requests to the Dockerfiles and the template JSONs.
4. Begin reviewing the backlog of known bugs and identifying issues to work on. Please write to che-dev@eclipse.org or hop on the #eclipseche IRC channel to talk about how you might approach solving issues.
5. Contribute new plug-ins or enhancements to existing ones.
