This is the staging directory for extensions and plug-ins. Che packages extensions and plug-ins into 
Web application packages that are then deployed by Che. Your plug-ins and extensions are placed into
an appropriate directory, which indicates which package the extension will be packaged into. Run 
bin/che-intsall-plugin create the new packages.

Place your plug-in artifacts (JARs / ZIPs) in:
  /ide       : Your plug-in is an IDE extension & hosted in Che's ide.war for browser clients.
  /che       : Your plug-in is a server-side extension & packaged into Che's ide.war for browser clients to connect.
  /workspace : Your plug-in is a server-side extension & packaged into the workspace's ide.war installed into a workspace's machine.
  /          : Your plug-in will be installed everywhere. (Not Recommended)

You extension is compiled into one of two web applications. One application is deployed into the Che server.
The second web application is deployed as part of the workspace agent inside of each machine powering a workspace. While
you can deploy your plug-in into both locations, this can be costly as you are generated two substantial web applications.
It is recommended for you to place your extension into the folder that indicates the type of extension it is. 

Run che-install-plugin from the /bin directory to create new web apps that include your extensions. The resulting web app
packages are copied into your assembly, overwriting the existing web app packages that Che is using. You can use the
--output flag to place the generated packages into a different location.
